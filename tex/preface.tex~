Welcome to the 25th meeting of \emph{Computational Linguistics in The Netherlands}! 
\\ \\
For a quarter century now, the field of Computational Linguistics in The Netherlands 
and Belgium has managed to organize successful yearly meetings without any central 
structure or financing. Our model has been copied in many countries, but the original 
still stands out both in quantity and quality of participation. 
\\ \\
As a veteran of CLIN 1 in Utrecht (October 26, 1990), I'm happy and proud that this 
historical edition of CLIN is organized in Antwerp by the CLiPS research centre. We 
tried to make it memorable with Belgian beer, chocolate fountains, and a conference 
dinner at the Antwerp Zoo. For the occasion of the \nth{25} edition, we also organized a 
special event looking back and looking forward, with eminent professors who have 
defined the field in the past and promising young researchers who will redefine it in 
the future.
\\ \\
The CLIN proper will be business as usual: an inspiring keynote speaker, Tony Veale, 
on computational linguistic creativity, 89 contributed presentations and posters about 
work in progress, and opportunities to catch up with colleagues and friends. As usual, 
too much will be going on at the same time, but you will get an excellent view on the 
liveliness, scope, and energy of the field of Computational Linguistics in this part of 
the world.
\\ \\
As in previous years, a thesis prize sponsored by STIL (Stichting Toepassing 
Inductieve Leertechnieken) will be awarded to the best MA-thesis in Computational 
Linguistics. 
\\ \\
Many thanks are due to the Department of Linguistics and our other sponsors for their 
contribution to CLIN 2015, and to my co-organizers Ben Verhoeven, Guy De Pauw, 
Mike Kestemont, and Janneke van de Loo. Thanks also to Tom De Smedt for 
graphical design, to Chris Emmery for compiling the book of abstracts, and to our 
volunteer students.
\\ \\
Finally, remember that we have the peer-reviewed CLIN Journal\footnote{\url{http://www.clinjournal.org/}} where selections of papers from CLIN conferences are 
published. All authors of accepted contributions will be invited to submit a paper to 
Volume 5 of the Journal. 
\\ \\
Enjoy CLIN 25!
